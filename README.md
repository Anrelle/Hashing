## Library Management System

## What is it?

The Simple Library Management System is a Java program that uses a hash table to store and manage book information. It allows users to add books, search for books by title, and display all books and their authors.


## What Can It Do

• Add Books: Users can add books with their titles and authors.

• Search Books: Allows users to search for a book by its title and display the author.

• Display All Books: Shows a list of all books stored in the system.

## Why I Made This Application

I created this program to demonstrate how a hash table can be used in managing data like books in a library system. It allows for quick addition and searching of books, which is useful in real-world library or catalog systems

## Contribution to the Community

• It provides a simple implementation of a hash table for beginners.

• It can be expanded to more complex systems for managing digital libraries, book loans, and cataloging.

## How It Works

• The program uses a hash table where the book title is the key and the author's name is the value.

• Users can add books, search for a book by title, or display all the books in the library system.
